<h1>COMP3000</b1>

<h2> What is this? </h2>
  
  COMP3000 is my final year project for Computing and Games Developement at Plymouth University
  
  The objective is to make a product and I decided to make a demo of a party board game. This demo demonstrates a variety of skills from data structures to scene management. 
  
<h2> The game </h2>
 
  The game demos the features of a party board game. 2-4 players must battle it out on a board game to collect as many diamonds as they can. Every 3 rounds, the game goes to a     minigame. Players will face eachother off in a minigame, with the winner gaining the most number of coins. These coins can be used on diamonds when they get to a spot. 
 
<h2> Game Requirements </h2>
  
  The game is only a demo and doesn't have too many demanding features, so should be able to run on a variety of computers. 
  
  The game requires 2 - 4 controllers to be connected
  
  
<h2> How to download? </h2>
  
  To download this project, go to the release section.
  Download the zip file.
  Once downloaded extract the files from the zip.
  Go into the newly extracted folder and run the BGI.exe
  
  
<h2> How to play?</h2>
  One on the main menu press "Play" to begin the game. When the sceen goes black, press a button on any controller you want to connect.
  
  Once all players join press Y or the equivilent for your controller, the image below compares Xbox and PlayStation controllers. Use these diagrams for reference if required.

  Once in the game all the players can have the first roll to decide the order. Roll by pressing A or equivilant.
  
  Once the play order is decided, take in turns between players to roll the dice with A or equivilant.
  
  Take in turns until minigame. All other instructions are in game.
